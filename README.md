For this assignement I started by adding the alt tags to the images. Then I tried adding some HTML5 elements. I added nav tags for the navigation header but then that kind of messed up things. I then changed the div for the nav in css and that made it look a little better.

I looked for the code that made the heart emoji and it was able to render just the same!

I also added more HTML5 elements such as the aside and sections. 

I added a clear fix to try to match the aside with the content but that just messed with the blocks in the page. I added a position absolute to the aside and the fixed some of the blocks on the page.

I think there was more I could have done. I will continue working on this even after submitting it.
